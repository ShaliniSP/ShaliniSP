Hi, Welcome to my git repository! <br />
I'm Shalini Sai Prasad and I’m interested in developing large scale software systems efficiently and helping reduce developer time. <br />
My research passions are in Program Synthesis, Verification and Repair and I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help scale low-code/no-code environments. <br />
